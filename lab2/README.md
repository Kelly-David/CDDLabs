## Lab Two
Rendevous Pattern. A redevous pattern implementation using semahpores.

### Usage
To run:
        
        make
        
	./ [executable]
	
Generate docs: 
        
	doxygen


### Sepcification
Using the Semaphore class create a program that demonstrates the Rendezvous pattern. As before (and always) you must also incldue the Doxygen settings file and a Makefile. The makefile must now also include a “clean” rule that deletes all .o files from the project.
