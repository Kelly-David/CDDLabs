## Lab Three
Demonstration of mutual exclusion using semaphores.

### Usage
To run:
        
        make
        
	./ [executable]
	
Generate docs: 
        
	doxygen


### Sepcification
Using the Semaphore class create a program that demonstrates Mutual Exclusion. You must  incldue the Doxygen settings file and a Makefile.  The makefile must now also include a “clean” rule that deletes all .o files from the project and a debug option that allows use of the gdb debugger.
